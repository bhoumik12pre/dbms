Consider the given Database Schema:
employee (employee-name, street, city)
works (employee-name, company-name, salary)
company (company-name, city)
manages (employee-name, manager-name)
 Find the names and cities of residence of all employees who work for First Bank
Corporation.
 Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities as the companies
for which
they work.
 Find all employees in the database who do not work for First Bank Corporation.
 Assume that the companies may be located in several cities. Find all companies
located in every city in which Small Bank Corporation is located.
 Find the company that has the most employees.
 Find those companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than
the average salary at First Bank Corporation

Step 1: Create Tables

CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_name VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    street VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE works (
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    company_name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_name, company_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name)
);

CREATE TABLE company (
    company_name VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE manages (
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_name, manager_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name)
);


Step 2: Insert Sample Data

-- Insert data into employee table
INSERT INTO employee (employee_name, street, city) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'MG Road', 'Delhi'),
('Ravi Kumar', 'Park Street', 'Kolkata'),
('Meena Patel', 'Churchgate', 'Mumbai'),
('John Doe', 'Baker Street', 'London'),
('Rita Singh', 'Main Street', 'Mumbai'),
('Sanjay Gupta', 'Lake Road', 'Delhi');

-- Insert data into works table
INSERT INTO works (employee_name, company_name, salary) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'First Bank Corporation', 12000),
('Ravi Kumar', 'First Bank Corporation', 9500),
('Meena Patel', 'Small Bank Corporation', 8000),
('John Doe', 'First Bank Corporation', 11000),
('Rita Singh', 'Tech Solutions', 15000),
('Sanjay Gupta', 'Small Bank Corporation', 7000);

-- Insert data into company table
INSERT INTO company (company_name, city) VALUES
('First Bank Corporation', 'New York'),
('Small Bank Corporation', 'San Francisco'),
('Tech Solutions', 'Mumbai');

-- Insert data into manages table
INSERT INTO manages (employee_name, manager_name) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'John Doe'),
('Ravi Kumar', 'Amit Sharma'),
('Meena Patel', 'Ravi Kumar'),
('Rita Singh', 'John Doe'),
('Sanjay Gupta', 'Meena Patel');


Step 3: Queries

Find the names and cities of residence of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation.

SELECT e.employee_name, e.city
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee_name = w.employee_name
WHERE w.company_name = 'First Bank Corporation';


Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities as the companies for which they work.

SELECT e.employee_name
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee_name = w.employee_name
JOIN company c ON w.company_name = c.company_name
WHERE e.city = c.city;


Find all employees in the database who do not work for First Bank Corporation.


SELECT employee_name
FROM works
WHERE company_name != 'First Bank Corporation';


Find all companies located in every city in which Small Bank Corporation is located.

SELECT DISTINCT w1.company_name
FROM works w1
JOIN company c1 ON w1.company_name = c1.company_name
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT city
    FROM company c2
    WHERE c2.company_name = 'Small Bank Corporation'
    AND c2.city NOT IN (
        SELECT city
        FROM company c3
        WHERE c3.company_name = w1.company_name
    )
);


Find the company that has the most employees.

SELECT company_name
FROM works
GROUP BY company_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_name) DESC
LIMIT 1;


Find those companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than the average salary at First Bank Corporation.

SELECT w1.company_name
FROM works w1
GROUP BY w1.company_name
HAVING AVG(w1.salary) > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM works
    WHERE company_name = 'First Bank Corporation'
);
