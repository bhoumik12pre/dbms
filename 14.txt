Explanation of Queries
The first query uses AND to filter employees who work at "IBM" and live in "Pune."
The second query uses OR to select employees who either work at "Infosys" or have a salary above 30000.
The third query selects employees who work at "IBM" but excludes those living in "Mumbai."
The fourth query groups employees by company_name and retrieves the maximum salary for each company.
The fifth query calculates the average salary for each company and filters to show only those with an average higher than "IBM"’s average salary.
