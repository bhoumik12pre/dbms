Step 1: Create Tables


CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    street VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_name)
);

CREATE TABLE works (
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    company_name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_name, company_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name)
);

CREATE TABLE company (
    company_name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (company_name)
);

CREATE TABLE manages (
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_name, manager_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_name) REFERENCES employee(employee_name)
);



Step 2: Insert Sample Data

-- Insert data into employee table
INSERT INTO employee (employee_name, street, city) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'MG Road', 'Delhi'),
('Ravi Kumar', 'Park Street', 'Kolkata'),
('Meena Patel', 'Churchgate', 'Mumbai'),
('John Doe', 'Baker Street', 'London'),
('Rita Singh', 'Main Street', 'Mumbai'),
('Sanjay Gupta', 'Lake Road', 'Delhi');

-- Insert data into works table
INSERT INTO works (employee_name, company_name, salary) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'First Bank Corporation', 12000),
('Ravi Kumar', 'First Bank Corporation', 9500),
('Meena Patel', 'Small Bank Corporation', 8000),
('John Doe', 'First Bank Corporation', 11000),
('Rita Singh', 'Tech Solutions', 15000),
('Sanjay Gupta', 'Small Bank Corporation', 7000);

-- Insert data into company table
INSERT INTO company (company_name, city) VALUES
('First Bank Corporation', 'New York'),
('Small Bank Corporation', 'San Francisco'),
('Tech Solutions', 'Mumbai');

-- Insert data into manages table
INSERT INTO manages (employee_name, manager_name) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'John Doe'),
('Ravi Kumar', 'Amit Sharma'),
('Meena Patel', 'Ravi Kumar'),
('Rita Singh', 'John Doe'),
('Sanjay Gupta', 'Meena Patel');


Step 3: Solve the Queries

Find the names of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation.

SELECT employee_name
FROM works
WHERE company_name = 'First Bank Corporation';


Find the names, street addresses, and cities of residence of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation and earn more than $10,000.

SELECT e.employee_name, e.street, e.city
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee_name = w.employee_name
WHERE w.company_name = 'First Bank Corporation' AND w.salary > 10000;


Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities and on the same streets as their managers.


SELECT e.employee_name
FROM employee e
JOIN manages m ON e.employee_name = m.employee_name
JOIN employee mgr ON m.manager_name = mgr.employee_name
WHERE e.city = mgr.city AND e.street = mgr.street;


Find all employees in the database who earn more than each employee of Small Bank Corporation.

SELECT e.employee_name
FROM works e
WHERE e.salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM works WHERE company_name = 'Small Bank Corporation');


Find all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of their company.

SELECT w.employee_name
FROM works w
JOIN (SELECT company_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM works GROUP BY company_name) AS avg_salaries
ON w.company_name = avg_salaries.company_name
WHERE w.salary > avg_salaries.avg_salary;


Find the company that has the smallest payroll.

SELECT company_name
FROM works
GROUP BY company_name
ORDER BY SUM(salary) ASC
LIMIT 1;
